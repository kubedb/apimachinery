                        Represents a Persistent Disk resource in AWS.

                        An AWS EBS disk must exist before mounting to a container. The disk must also be in the same AWS zone as the kubelet. An AWS EBS disk can only be mounted as read/write once. AWS EBS volumes support ownership management and SELinux relabeling.

                GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.

                If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).

If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.

                If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).

                                            partition for /dev/sda is "0" (or you
                                            can leave the property empty). More info:

                                    Represents a Persistent Disk resource in AWS.

                                    An AWS EBS disk must exist before mounting to a container. The disk must also be in the same AWS zone as the kubelet. An AWS EBS disk can only be mounted as read/write once. AWS EBS volumes support ownership management and SELinux relabeling.

                                    An AWS EBS disk must exist before mounting to a container. The disk must also be in the same AWS zone as the kubelet. An AWS EBS disk can only be mounted as read/write once. AWS EBS volumes support ownership management and SELinux relabeling.

                                        A GCE PD must exist before mounting to a container. The disk must also be in the same GCE project and zone as the kubelet. A GCE PD can only be mounted as read/write once or read-only many times. GCE PDs support ownership management and SELinux relabeling.
